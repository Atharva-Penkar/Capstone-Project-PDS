This is the Programming and Data Structures (PDS) Laboratory Project done by members- Aditya Dhananjay Singh, Atharva Atul Penkar, Harshil Singh, Kumar Snehal, Soham Chakraborty

The project is a code written in C language which contains an arcade consisting of three games- 2048, Air Hockey and Snake. It uses graphics.h libraries to print visuals in a graphics window. All coding was done in Devcpp IDE and code editor and the compiler used was TDM Gcc. A resources zip folder is also included which contains images used in the program.
